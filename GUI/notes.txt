Introduction
    Java Swing is suited for beginners and intermediate Swing developers
    Swing is the principal GUI toolkit for the Java programming language
        Used to create Graphical user interfaces with java
    Platform independent, customizable, extensible, configurable, lightweight
    rich set of widgets
    part of the JFC
    JAVAFX used for advanced animations

JAVA Swing first programs
    Create a simple applicaiton, terminate applicaiton with a quit button, display a frame icon, display a tooltip, and use mnemonics and display standard colors
    Java swing components are basic building blocks of a Java Swing application
    JFrame, JButton, JLabel
    JFrame is a top-level window with a title and border, used to organize other components
    JButton is a push button used to perform an action
    JLabel is a component used to display a short text string or image
    Java Swing First Example
        SimpleEx.java
        Window can be resized, maximized, or minimized
        Import the swing classes
        SimpleEx inherits from the JFrame component
            JFrame top-level
        basic purpose of containers is to hold components of the application
        Good programming practice to not put the application code into constructors, but delegate the task to a specified method
            Method being initUI();
        Sets are pretty self explanatory
            setLocation - centers the window on the screen
            setDefault - close the window if we click on the close button
        EventQueue.invokeLater
            create an instance of code and make it visible on screen
            method places the applicaiton on the Swing Event Queue
            used to ensure that all UI updates are concurrency-safe
                prevents the GUI from hanging
    JButton Example
        Have a Button, when click on the button, the application terminates
        QuitButtonEx, ive added notes inside the programs
    JFrame Icon
        Display an icon on a frame, shown in the left part of the title bar
        FrameIconEx.java
    JavaSwing tooltip
        Tooltips are internal application's help system
        Swing shows a small window if we hover a mouse pointer over an object that has a tooltip set
        TooltipEx.java
    Swing mnemonics
        Mnemonics are shortcut keys that activate a component that supports mnemonics
            labels, buttons or menu items
        MnemonicEx.java
    JavaSwing standard colors
        color class defines 13 color values
        StandardColoursEx.java
        Example shows thirteen JLabel components, JLabel usually used to display text, but it can display colors too
    JavaSwing mouse move events
        MouseMotionAdapter is used for receiving mouse motion events
        Display the coordinates of a mouse pointer in a label component
        MouseMoveEventEx.java
