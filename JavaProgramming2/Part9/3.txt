Object Polymorphism
    encountered situations where reference-type variables have other types besides their own one
    all objects are of type Object
    In addition to each variable's original type, each variable can also be represented by the types of interfaces it implmements and classes that it inherits
        String class inherits the Object class, Object class does not inherit a String class
    java.lang.Object -> java.lang.String
    in java each class can inherit one class at most
        as such a class may indirectly inherit more than a single class

Programmers can expect all objects to have the methods toString, hashCode, and equals because each object is of type Object
    in addition to their own type
Inheritence and interface allow us to implmement methods and constructors that handle many kinds of objects
