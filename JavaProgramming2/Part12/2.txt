ArrayList and hash table
    ArrayList and HashMap are commonly used data structures in programing
    Take a look at their actual implementation

A brief recap of arrays
    An array is an object that contains a limited number of places for values
    size of an array is always predetermined, chosen when the array is created
    array type is defined with [] preceded by the type of the elements in the array
        created with a new call
    int[] numbers = new int[3]
    elements of an array are referred to by the indexes
        numbers[0] = 2;
        numbers[0]
    to discover the length of the array
        numbers.length
    examining the numbers one by one can be used with a for loop
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){}
    Programming Exercise
        Sum these for me (Program02)
    Arrays can be used in the exact same manner as other variables
        object variables, method parameters, return values of methods and so on
    significant portion of generally used data structures use arrays in their internal implementation

Lists
    Java ArrayList uses an array
    the type of elements in the array is defined by the type parameter given to the ArrayList
    add, contains, remove, and get
    Creating a new list
        ArrayList class, grows as needed
    Checking the existence of a value
        each java object inherits the Object class
            public boolean equals(Object object)
    Removing a value
    Programming Exercise
        List.java

Hash Map
    implemented as an array, in which every element includes a list
    list contain key, value pairs
    user can search from the hash map based on the key, also add new key-value pairs to it
        each key can appear at most once
    when a new pair is stored in a hash map, we calculate a hash value based on the key stored
        hash value decides the index of the interanl array that will be used for storing
    HashMap and Pair.java
