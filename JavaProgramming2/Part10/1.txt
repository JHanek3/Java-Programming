Handling collections with streams
    create a stream from a collection
    filter the values of a stream
    transform the values of a stream
    collect values of a stream to another collection
Lambda expression
Order objects using the Java Comparable interface
    regex, enumerate type and interator

Handling Collections as streams
    collections as streams of values
    stream is a way of going through a colleciton of data such that the programmer determines the operation to be performed on each value
        no record is kept
    with streams, the programmer defines a sequence of events that is executed for each value in a collection
    stream does not change the values in the original data collection
        merely processes them
    retain transformations, need to compile into another data collection
    stream can be formed from any object that implements the Collection interface with the stream() method
        string values are mapped to integer using mapToInt(value -> conversion)
        then use filter
        .count()

Lambda Expressions
    why are function written in the form value -> value > 5?
    called lambda expression
    shorthand provided by Java for anonymous methods that do not have an owner, not part of a class or interface
    function contains both the parameter definition and the function body
    functions that handle stream elements cannot change values of variables outside of the function
        due to static method behavoir, during a method call there is no access to any variables outside of the method

Stream Methods
    divided into two categories, intermediate operations for processing elements or terminal operations that the processing of elements
    filter and mapToInt intermediate operations
        return a value that can be further processed
    average method is a terminal operation
        returns a value to be processed
    Starting point list of values, stream() method called
        a stream of lilst values is created, values are dealt with individually
        stream values then become filtered
        map method can be used to map values in a stream from one form to another
        collect method collects the values in a stream into a collection provided to it
        .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));.
Programming Exercise
    Positive Numbers

Terminal Operators
    count, counting the number of values on a list 
    forEach, for going through a list values
        what is done to each list value and terminated the stream processing
    collect, gathering the list values into a data structure
        collect stream values into another collection
        collect method is given as a parameter to the Collectors objects
    reduce, for combining the list items
Programming Exercise
    Divisble

Reduce method is useful when you want to combine stream elements to some other form
    reduce(*initialState*, (*previous*, *object*) -> *actions on the object*)
    int sum = values.stream()
        .reduce(0, (previousSum, value) -> previousSum + value);
    System.out.println(sum);

Intermediate Operations
    methods that return a stream
        can call intermediate operations sequentially
    converting a value from one to another with map
        mapToInt
    filter, distinct and sorted

Objects and Stream
    Handling objects using stream methods is natural
    each stream method that deals with the streams values also enables you to call methods related to the values

Files and Streams
    Streams are very handy for handling files
    file is read in stream form using Java's ready-made File class
    lines method in the files allows you to create an input stream from a filew, allowing you to process the rows one by one
        gets a path as a parameter, which is created using the 'get' method in the Paths class
        get method is provided a string describing the file path

    Reading Files Per Line
Stream methods make the reading of files taht are of predefined form relatively straightforward
