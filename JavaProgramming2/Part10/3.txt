Other useful techniques
String Builder
    calling numbers + i, creates a new string
    string creation, unnoticeable at a small scale
        space is allocated in memory for each string
    StringBuilder class provides a way to concatenate strings without the need to create them
    new StringBuilder()
        content is added to the object using the overloaded appened method
    StringBuilder numbers = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
        numbers.append(i);
    }
    System.out.println(numbers.toString());

Regular Expressions
    defines a set of strings in compact form
    verify the correctness of strings
    definiong a suitable regex expression
        matches method of the String class, which cheks whether the string matces the regular expression given as a parameter
    if (number.matches("01[0-9]{7}"))

Alternation (Vertical Line)
    a vertical line indicates that parts of a regex are optional
    00||111||0000 mathces 00 not 1111

Affecting Part of a String (Parentheses)
    you can use () to determine which part of a regex is affected by the rules inside the ()
    00000 and 00001
        00000|00001
        0000(0|1) specifies the strings 
    car(|s)
        car or cars

Quantifiers
    particular sub-string is repeated in a string
    * repeats 0 times
    + repeats 1 time
    ? repeats 0 or 1 times 
    {a} repeats a times
    {a,b} repeats a to b times
    {a,} repeats at least a times

Character Classes (Square Brackets)
    can be used to specify a set of characters in a compact way
    [145] means (1|4|5)
    [a-c]* means the expression requies the string to only contain a-c

Enumerated Type - Enum
    know the possible values of a variable in advance, you can use class of type enum
    enumerated type to represent the values
    enum lists the constant values it declares separated by a comma
        conventionally written with capital letters
    enums are comapred with an equals sign
        enum fields get a unique number code

Object references in Enums
    enumerated types may contain object reference variables
        set in an internal constructor of the class defining the enumerated type
        private access modifier, cannot have a public constructor

Iterator
    hasNext(), used to ask if there are any objects still to be iterated over
        yes, next() object in line can be requested
    if you want to remove some of the objects from the list during traversal, you can do so using iterator
        calling the remove method of the iterator object neatly removes the list the item returned by the iterator with the previous next call
