Packages
    name the classes in a sensible manner and planning them so that each class has one clear responsibility
        divide the classes into packages
    classes in one package might share functionality, purpose or some othe logical property
    dictionaries in which the source code files are organized
    right click on source packages and select new java package
    create classes inside a package the same way you can in the default package
        package library;
        public class Program
    the package of a class is noted at the beginning of the source file, below the claass is in the package
    every package including the default package may contain other packages
        libary.domain - used to refer to the storage space of the classes that represent the coneccpts of the problem domain
    a class can access classes inside a package by using the import statement
        the class book in the package library.domain is made available with
        import library.domain.Book;
    imports after source code file
Programming Exercise
    First Packages, functionality inside mooc package
    Three packages

Directory Structure in a file system
    every project is in your computer's file system or on a centralized server
    src/main/java contains the source code files of the program
        package of a class is library then src/main/java/library
Packages and access modifiers
    private usde to define variables and methods that ore only visible inside the class where they are defined
        cannot be used outside
    public available for everyone to use
    you can opt out of public and void, so that only the classes inside the package can use the methods and variables
        void ....
        if the class is in a different package, the method printTitle will not be caleld

Classes that represent concepts of the problem domain
    classes that represent concepts of the problem domain are often placed inside a package called domain
    application logic is typically kept separate from the classes that represent concepts of the problem domain
        package logic
    user interface is seperate from the application logic and the classes that represent the problem domain
