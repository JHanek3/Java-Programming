Part 11
    Become Familiar with packages in Java and learn what the different parts of an import statement mean
    Practice using execeptions in java
Class Diagrams
    used in designing and modeling softeare to describe classes and their relationships
    model software in high level of abstraction
    diagram shows the names and attributes of the classes, connections between the classes and sometimes the methods of the classes
    UML
Describing class and class attributes
    class is represented by a rectabngle with the name of the class written on the top, line below the name of the class divides the name from the list
        of attributes (names and types of class variables)
    attributeName: attributeType
    + public, - private
Describing class constructor
    list the contructor and all other methods below the attributes
    +/- depending on visibilty of the method, method name, paratmeters and their types
    +Person(initialName: String)
Describing Class Methods
    constructors are listed first and then class methods
    also write the return type of a method in the class diagram
    +printPerson(): void
Class diagram describes the structure of an object not its functionality
Programming Exercise
    Customer Class Diagram, Customer Class with 3 private attributes that are all strings
    Customer
    _________
    -name:String
    -address: String
    -email: String
    Book and Plane

Connections between classes
    connections are shown via arrows
        arrows also show the direction
    variables which refer to other objects are not written with the rest of the class attributes, but are shown as connections between the classes
    Book -->author Person
    A Book knows the author, but a Person does not know about books they are the author of
    List?
        Book -->* Person
        star tells us that a book can have between 0 and unlimited number of authors
Programming Exercise
    Show and ticket
    arrow from ticket to show

No arrowhead connection, both classes know about each other
    no star on the connection, the connection is singular
Programming Exercise
    Student and University
    Two classes, university has star to students and students has a singular connection to university

Describing inheritance
    inheritance is decribed by an arrow with a triangle head
    triangle points to the class being inherited from
    engine inherits the class part
    add description <<abstract>>
        above the name of the class
Programming Exercise
    The Player and The Boot

Describing interfaces
    written <<interface>>
    implementing an interface is shown as a dashed arrow with a triangle arrowhead
    Book ----> <<interface>> Readable

How these should be drawn?
    Describe a problem and a problem-domain to others
    designing a program with multiple classes
    Design phase
    Suitable level of abstraction
